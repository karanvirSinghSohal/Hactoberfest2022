Hello everyone!

Past weekend I tried to finish all my work. I have finished 2 of my models in freecad and made functions in my beam design program. Today i have rendered my freecad models and also made corrections in my beam program. After that I worked with Gurbhej sir to transfer the staad output in excel without coping. Other than that I have told Gagan and Jaskiran about scheduling in freecad.
